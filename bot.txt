yah i just confirmed with the team so about insurance , its like for public bots , it would be just like copy trading , when the       │
│   creator starts the bot then the trade happens in all and then when it comes to insurance , basically its going to be like the creator  │
│   first applies for insurance and there we have few conditions for the creator to match so here the thing is for the creator to while    │
│   creating the public  bot it will be having the options of firstly the amount he needed for the trade to start , so he can enter the amount like 35k or something like that , so now the start would be enabled only once that 35k is fullfilled , so here the thing is the public users should be able to come and lock their amount here , what ever they are planning to give for this bot , so its like crowdfuncing so once that amount reaches 35k then creator gets option for start and then we have the locking period whihc is min of 30 days and creator can extend it upto 1 year and them coming to the main part , the conditions for applying for insurance is that the creator should lock the 50% of the amount he is requesting for the trade like its 35k i requested for the corwdfunding for the bot trade i should first lock the 17.5k the 50% of 35 so this amount would be locked and so here once the trade period ends which the creator set , like for example 30 days so if they are in profit then the creator funds will also get released so we will be only taking 5% of it and release remaining amount , now in the same way when loooked on user side here if the trade is insured by teh creator as said above now the user if wanted can buy the insurance which would be 10% of the trade amount they are planning to lock , so here what ever the creator set , so untill that period the amount would be locked and user cant get that back , so after the bot trading session if the trade is at loss then we will be taking up the creators locked amount and we will be using it to compensate users who took insurance   , so once approved now user would not get  │
│   the insurance automatically , it would be like user now can see the option to buy insurance for this bot if the admin has approved     │
│   the creator request , so if the admin rejected or the creator didnt apply for any insurance then user cant buy the insurance for that  │
│   bot because the creator didnt apply for it , so now
